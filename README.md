# Predict taxi fares: A regression problem

In the repository, the data has been taken from a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview). 

There are 3 files for training, testig and submission data.

This is to give an insight of how to handle a large dataset followed by EDA and applying regression model to predict the output. 

Hope this code will help you in clearing the basic concept of regression problems :)
